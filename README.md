*A project of my own that performs purchases and sales at the broker IQOption, based on peaks formed by SMA moving averages*

## Requirements
Before we start, you will need some donwloads to run the project correctly in your machine. First, you need to install our interpreter [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Second, i recommend you use as IDLE [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/pycharm/download/) because was the IDLE that i have used to code the bot and saves you a lot of time while you coding.
You will need too some new libralies, and you can install it typing in yout terminal IDLE _pip intall libraryName_. 
* _pip install talib_
* _pip install numpy_

As i said before, i used [iqoptionapi](https://github.com/Lu-Yi-Hsun/iqoptionapi/) to project the bot. The API creator has two versions, a free version and a paid version. Lucky for us, we can do all of the functions without any problems using the free version. To install this version of the API, all you have to do is download it by clicking on _donwload zip_

After that, you have to open the file you donwloaded and copy the folder inside the zip file and paste it into the bot's code file.
