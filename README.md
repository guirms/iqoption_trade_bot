A project of my own that performs purchases and sales at the broker IQOption, based on peaks formed by SMA moving averages

## Requirements
Before we start, you will need some donwloads to run the project correctly in your machine. First, i recommend you use as IDLE [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/pycharm/download/) because was the IDLE that i have used to code the bot and saves you a lot of time thanks to its internal functions. You will need to some new libralies, and you can install it typing in yout terminal IDLE _pip intall libraryName_

## About the API

As i said before, i used the [iqoptionapi](https://github.com/Lu-Yi-Hsun/iqoptionapi/) to project the bot. The creator of API has two versions of it, a free version and a paid version. For our luck, we can did all of the functions without problem using the free version. To install the API, all you need to do is download it clicking in _donwload zip_

after that, you need to open the file you donwloaded and copy the folder inside the zip file and paste it into the file you are using to make the code.
